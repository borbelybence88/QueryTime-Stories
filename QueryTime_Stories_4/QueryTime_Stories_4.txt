QueryTime Stories #4
Once upon a time, there was a peaceful kingdom where everybody lived happily. But it wasn't always like this. Centuries ago, three brothers were fighting for the throne — until the youngest finally won and brought peace and wealth to the land.

During the time of war, the three princes kept replacing each other on the throne again and again.

We wanted to see when each of them ruled during those war-torn decades. But our table only had two columns: year and name.

If we used MIN() and MAX() on the years, grouped by name, we got incorrect results — the princes kept switching places, so their reigns overlapped. We needed an extra column to determine how many times each prince ruled.

So here’s what I did:

- I compared the current row’s king with the previous one, ordered by year. If there was a change, I marked it with a 1 in a change flag column.
- Then I calculated a running total of the change flags to identify distinct reign periods.
- With that, I could finally apply MIN() and MAX() to the years, grouping not just by name, but also by the reign/session column.

You can check the details in the shared images and in the QueryTime Stories repo (link in comments).

(I used Databricks for the SQL part of this demo — some functions may differ in other environments.)
