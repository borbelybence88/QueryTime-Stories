QueryTime Stories #1
Once upon a time, there was a messy table with campaign details and overlapping periods.

I was working with a table containing campaign details, including "from" and "to" date fields — but the periods were overlapping, even though they shouldn't have been.
Each user should have only one campaign per day, and it should be the one with the highest priority.

At first, I came up with a solution that worked, but I wasn't satisfied with it.
Then, I got a great hint from Gabor Tari: use a date table!
So here's what I did:
• Generated a date table.
• Joined it with the original table, resulting in a daily-level table with all campaigns.
• Used ROW_NUMBER() to select the highest priority campaign per day.
• Calculated the MIN and MAX dates per campaign.

The result: a table with the same structure — now without overlaps.

You can see the detailed scripts in the shared images and in the QueryTime Stories repo (link in the comments).
(I used Databricks for this demo — some functions may differ in other environments.)
